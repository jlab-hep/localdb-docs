# MongoDB

## Getting Start

Just type 'mongo' to check if the MongoDB service is running.

```bash
$ mongo
MongoDB shell version v3.6.16
> exit
bye
$
```

If the service doesn't seem to be running,<br>
maybe the package has not been installed or the service has not been started, <br>
so please check [pre requirement page](requirements.md) to install/start the service.

Finish!
